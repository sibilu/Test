# Virtual Reconstruction of the Ambisonic Concert Hall at the Royal Danish Academy of Music
In this project we present a simulation and validation of the Ambisonic concert hall at the Royal Danish Academy of Music (RDAM), which was inaugurated on September 19th, 2019 in Copenhagen. Validation with experts showed that the simulated ambisonic room was perceived to match the acoustic- and spatial attributes of its real counterpart.
